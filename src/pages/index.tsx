            About
          </h4>
          <p>
            When classrooms shut down, so did our students. Frustrated and at
            our wits end, everything changed with one simple idea:{" "}
            <i>What if we transform our classrooms into a giant game?</i> Not a
            game for learning content, but a game to empower kids to care about
            their education. Experience points and gold became the classroom
            currency as students leveled up their characters. Monsters were
            defeated and treasures were collected. When the smoke had cleared,
            one thing was for certain: Now that education was gamified, there
            was no going back.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We exist to help teachers discover the joy of gamifying their
            classroom â€” empowering all students to become the best versions of
            themselves.
